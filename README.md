### About project
This is project for Software mansion competition. It's a mobile app build with react native, that allows you to browser images from Art Institute  Chicago collection.  
### What i have learned
I've learned basics of react native, expo and reanimated libary. It was first contact with mobile app development.

### App features

- Diffrent app tabs:
	- Explore
	- Search
	-  Favourites
	- Settings
- Clicking on heart next to artwork name or double tapping it, adds item to favorites 
- Click an artwork image to open modal with information about it
- Resetting list of favorite artworks in settings
- List of favourite artworks strored in device memory
### Problems faced
- Styles not working as i expected them to work
- Setting up naviagtion using expo router was more challenging that i initaly thought
- Zooming images (i still can't figure this out)
- Using list - I initaly used FlashList but for reasons uknown to me it begin to duplicated elements. I finally used flatlist, even though it has worse performance.
- Also debuging app was a lot harder than i expected. I coudnt find a way to see what is happening inside my app. Moreover error messages were not helpful.

Even though i struggled a bit, I find this exercise valuable :)
